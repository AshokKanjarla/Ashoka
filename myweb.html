<h2> This is my first passage</h2>
<p>Spun out of the Materials Science Department, University of Cambridge, Paragraf has one core focus… to deliver the speculated capabilities of graphene to the real world.
Building on fundamental science and high quality, independently qualified R&D, Paragraf has targeted the limiting factor preventing the true exploitation of graphene… manufacturing.
At our Cambridgeshire facility, we produce large area graphene to the highest quality, beyond current industry standards, </p>

My graphene journey started with a laugh! In 2014, I had an idea for making a device combining gallium nitride (GaN) with graphene. I phoned the leading graphene centre in the UK and asked them for a small piece of device-quality graphene about 2-inches across. There was a loud laugh on the other end of the phone, “Device-quality graphene 2-inches across doesn’t exist” they said.
I was astonished! After all the publicity about how graphene was going to change the world the reality was that good-quality graphene only 2-inches across wasn’t available.
In 2015, I recruited Simon Thomas into my research group in Cambridge to work on GaN. In his spare time he developed a new way of growing graphene. I had no graphene grant, but I did have an EPSRC Platform Grant for GaN which encouraged speculative research, so I diverted a few thousand pounds from this to support Simon’s research on graphene.
Another member of my research team, Ivor Guiney, worked with Simon to develop the growth of large-area graphene. What is amazing is that with this funding of only a few thousand pounds, they developed a new way to grow up to 8-inch diameter device-quality graphene, beating many other research groups and companies which had spent millions of dollars to try and achieve this.
Simon, Ivor and I founded Paragraf to exploit our graphene. We look forward to turning all the publicity about graphene the wonder material into reality.
